🍽️ Mess-Management System
📋 What's Needed
Keeping track of everything in a busy canteen can be tough. That's why we've created an easy solution using Python and some clever tricks to help out. Our goal is to make life easier for both the canteen staff and the diners. We want everyone to use our system without any hassle and always know what's happening with their meals.

With our system:
Canteen staff can see how many meals have been served in real-time.
Diners can easily cancel their orders if needed.
We're using smart techniques to handle all the meal data, keeping everything organized and allowing for easy updates whenever necessary.

💻 Technologies Used
Python 🐍: We chose Python for its simplicity, versatility, and powerful libraries.
SQLAlchemy 📊: This tool helps us interact with the database smoothly, making it easy to manage all the data.
Database Management System 🗄️: We use a relational database (like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) to store info about users, meal orders, inventory, and more.
Web Development 🌐: For web-based systems, we use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Flask to create a user-friendly interface and strong backend functionality.
